# Example from Steensgaard's paper

a := &x;
b := &y;
if (p) then {
  y := &z;
} else {
  y := &x;
};
c := &y;

# The final storage graph should have 5 nodes 
# a --> (x,z)
# b --> y
# c --> y 
# y --> (x,z)
# x,z is a bottom type (points nowhere)
# we ignore any variables in if() or while() conditions as they don't generate constraints
