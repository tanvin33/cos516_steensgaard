a := &b; # a points to b 
c := &d; # c points to d

# at this point in time we have a --> b  c-->d , x points nowhere (is bottom)
# when we dereference, we are saying x:=*a, so x := b 
# thus we want to merge the equivalence classes of the children of x and b
# BUT b is a bottom node, so we just change its type using settype

x := *a; # x with what a points to which is b 


# result should be 4 nodes: a, b, c, d, x
