# Test 5: While Loops 
# we should expect a list of 6 constraints from sil_parser

# While loop with 1 statement 
while (x < 10) {
    x := negate(x);
};

# While loop with several statements
while (x < 10) {
    x := negate(x);
    y := multiply(y, z);
};

# Nested While Loops
while (x < 10) {
    while (y < 3){
      z := x; 
      y := z;
    };
    x := negate(y);
